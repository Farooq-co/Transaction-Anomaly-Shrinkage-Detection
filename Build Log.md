# Transaction Anomaly & Shrinkage Detection

## Project Overview

The **Transaction Anomaly & Shrinkage Detection** project is a FastAPI-based analytics application designed to identify suspicious transactions and operational anomalies that may indicate fraud, shrinkage, or cashier discrepancies within a retail or fuel station environment.

The application follows a modular architecture that separates routing, business logic, data models, and database management into dedicated components. This structure improves maintainability, testing, and future scalability.

The project consists of:

* **FastAPI** for the web framework and API routing
* **Jinja2** templates for server-side rendered dashboards
* **Bootstrap 5** and **Chart.js** for responsive data visualization
* **SQLAlchemy** as the ORM layer
* **SQLite** as the project database
* **Scikit-learn** for anomaly detection
* **Poetry** for dependency management

Project modules include:

* **Routes** – Handle HTTP requests and responses.
* **Services** – Contain business logic, analytics, dashboard metrics, anomaly detection, and alert processing.
* **Models** – Define database entities.
* **Database** – Manages database connectivity and sessions.
* **Templates & Static Assets** – Provide the dashboard interface and styling.

### Isolation Forest Algorithm

For anomaly detection in this project, I used the Isolation Forest algorithm from Scikit-learn.

The main idea behind Isolation Forest is that anomalies are rare and different from normal data, so they are much easier to isolate.

Instead of learning what abnormal behavior looks like, the algorithm repeatedly creates random decision trees by randomly selecting:

a feature (such as transaction amount or refund count), and
a random split value for that feature.

Normal transactions require many splits to isolate because they are similar to many other records. However, suspicious transactions are isolated in only a few splits because they are very different from the majority of the data.

The algorithm calculates an anomaly score for every transaction:

Score close to -1: Highly anomalous (suspicious)
Score around 0 or positive: Normal transaction

In my project, I used features such as:

Transaction amount
Number of refunds
Shift sales
Void transactions
Discount amount (if available)

After training the Isolation Forest model, each transaction receives an anomaly score. Transactions identified as anomalies are stored as alerts and displayed on the dashboard with reasons like:

Unusually large refund
Abnormally high transaction amount
Suspicious cashier activity
Possible shrinkage or fraud
Why I Chose Isolation Forest

I selected Isolation Forest because:

It is an unsupervised learning algorithm, so it does not require labeled fraud data.
It works well on large datasets.
It is fast and efficient.
It is specifically designed for anomaly detection.
It is available in Scikit-learn and easy to integrate with FastAPI.
Implementation
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

model = IsolationForest(
    contamination=0.05,
    random_state=42
)

model.fit(features)

predictions = model.predict(features)
scores = model.decision_function(features)

Here:

fit() trains the model using transaction data.
predict() returns:
1 → Normal transaction
-1 → Anomalous transaction
decision_function() provides an anomaly score that can be used to rank alerts.
Example

Suppose most fuel transactions are between $30 and $120.

If one transaction suddenly has:

Amount = $2,000
Multiple refunds
Unusual cashier activity

Isolation Forest isolates this record very quickly and marks it as an anomaly because it is significantly different from the normal transaction patterns.
# Database Management

## SQLite vs. PostgreSQL Rationale

The project currently uses **SQLite** instead of PostgreSQL for several practical reasons.

### Simplicity

SQLite requires no separate database server or installation, making project setup straightforward for development and demonstration purposes.

### Lightweight Development

Because the application is intended for rapid prototyping and analytics experimentation, SQLite provides an efficient embedded database without additional infrastructure.

### Easy Distribution

The database is stored as a single file (`transaction_anomaly.db`), allowing the complete project—including data—to be shared without external database configuration.

### Reduced Configuration

Unlike PostgreSQL, SQLite does not require:

* database server installation
* user management
* network configuration
* connection pooling
* server administration

This minimizes setup complexity for contributors and evaluators.

### Suitable for Current Scale

The current application primarily performs analytics, dashboard reporting, anomaly detection, and seeded transaction processing. SQLite provides sufficient performance for these workloads during development.

PostgreSQL may be considered in future production deployments requiring higher concurrency, larger datasets, or distributed access.

## SQLite Integration Details

SQLite is integrated through SQLAlchemy.

Database management includes:

* SQLAlchemy ORM models
* Centralized database configuration
* Session management
* Persistent local database file
* ORM-based CRUD operations
* Model-based schema management

The project database currently stores entities including:

* Transactions
* Refunds
* Alerts
* Shift information

Business services interact with the database through SQLAlchemy rather than executing raw SQL queries, improving maintainability and portability.

## Development Workflow Summary

The project follows a layered architecture:

1. Incoming requests are handled by FastAPI routes.
2. Routes delegate business operations to dedicated service modules.
3. Services retrieve and process data using SQLAlchemy models.
4. Machine learning components analyze transactions for anomalies.
5. Dashboard metrics are generated and passed to Jinja2 templates.
6. Bootstrap and Chart.js render interactive visualizations in the browser.
7. SQLite stores all project data in a lightweight embedded database.

This separation of concerns improves readability, maintainability, and future extensibility while supporting rapid development and experimentation with anomaly detection techniques.
